# README Generator

# Description
Every project needs a good quality README with information about what the app is for, how to use it, how to install it, contrubutions, and a section to ask questions. 
This application uses the command-line and runs with Node.js. It will generate a README.md file according to the information you input into the terminal based on the prompted questions.
